# advent-of-code-2023

Solutions to the advent of code 2023. Aiming to use a different language each day. Please don't judge the code quality
too bad :)

### OFFICIAL LANGUAGE RANKINGS

_This is highly biased toward languages I already know, duh_.

1. (Day 01) **Go**: Its tried. Its true. Fast. Straightforward to write. Predictable. `*****` five star language.
2. (Day 02) **Nim**: Never used it. But after I got the basics, this was a one-shot. Except, an erroneous indentation messed up one submission; indentation as control flow is an L for me, and global scoping imported functions is another. `***--` three stars.

### Upcoming Languages?

- Javascript / TypeScript (I can't in good faith separate them)
- Python
- Rust

- C++ (If JS and TS can't be separated... maybe C++ can't either)
- C#
